## 1. Requirements

First of all make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) installed. Then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## 2. Configuration
You had to include your Language-DB as a JSON-File into the HTML-Document. Make sure you have tagged it with `i18n-data`. For example your document looks like this:

```html
<head>
  <link i18n-data rel="import" href="language.html">
</head>
<i18n-element>your.key.to.translate</i18n-element>
```

So your `language.html` should contain the following:

```json
{
  "en": {
    "your": {
      "key": {
        "to": {
          "translate
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Viewing Your Element

```
$ polymer serve --open
```

## Running Tests

```
$ polymer test
```
